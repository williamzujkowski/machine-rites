### 4. Workflow Integration Test Scenario

**Purpose:** Test automation and CI/CD capabilities

**Steps:**
1. Validate GitHub Actions workflows
2. Test Docker build processes
3. Verify automated testing
4. Check deployment automation
5. Test monitoring integration

**Expected Results:**
- CI/CD pipeline operational
- Automated testing working
- Docker builds successful
- Monitoring data collected

**Actual Results:**

- ✅ Docker configurations available
- ✅ Jest testing functional
- ⚠️ Monitoring partially implemented

### 5. Security Integration Test Scenario

**Purpose:** Ensure security controls and compliance

**Steps:**
1. Run security assessment
2. Test access controls
3. Validate encryption setup
4. Check audit logging
5. Verify compliance reporting

**Expected Results:**
- All security checks passing
- Access controls enforced
- Encryption properly configured
- Audit trail complete

**Actual Results:**
- ✅ Security framework available
- ✅ Comprehensive security scripts
- ⚠️ Some pre-commit hooks failing
- ✅ GPG and pass integration ready

## Test Results Summary

### Integration Success Rate: 62%

**Successful Integrations (✅):**
- Performance monitoring and testing
- Security framework and tooling
- Docker containerization
- Basic system tooling
- Configuration management

**Partial Integrations (⚠️):**
- Bootstrap and installation process
- Version upgrade procedures
- Workflow automation
- Pre-commit hook system

**Failed Integrations (❌):**

- SPARC methodology setup
- Automated CI/CD pipeline
- Complete migration framework

## Critical Integration Issues

### Issue 1: Claude-Flow Compatibility
**Severity:** Critical
**Impact:** Core coordination system non-functional
**Root Cause:** Node.js version mismatch
**Solution:** Rebuild or upgrade Node.js environment

### Issue 2: Missing Automation Framework
**Severity:** High
**Impact:** No CI/CD automation
**Root Cause:** GitHub Actions workflows not implemented
**Solution:** Create workflow definitions

### Issue 3: Incomplete Migration System
**Severity:** High
**Impact:** Difficult version upgrades
**Root Cause:** No formal migration process
**Solution:** Implement migration scripts

## Remediation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Week 1)
1. Fix Claude-Flow Node.js compatibility
2. Initialize SPARC configuration
3. Repair memory persistence

### Phase 2: Core Integration (Week 2)
1. Implement GitHub Actions workflows
2. Complete bootstrap script improvements
3. Add migration framework

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Week 3)
1. Complete performance toolchain
2. Enhance security integration
3. Add comprehensive testing

### Phase 4: Validation (Week 4)
1. Re-run all integration tests
2. Performance benchmarking
3. Security audit
4. Documentation updates

## Test Environment Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- Node.js v20+ (v21+ recommended for Claude-Flow)
- NPM v10+
- Git 2.34+
- Docker/Podman
- Linux/Unix environment

### Recommended Setup
- Multi-core system for parallel testing
- SSD storage for performance tests
- Network access for external dependencies
- GPG configured for security tests

## Continuous Integration Setup

### Automated Test Suite
```yaml
# Proposed GitHub Actions workflow
name: Integration Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  integration:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '21'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run integration tests
        run: npm run test:integration
      - name: Security assessment
        run: ./security/security-checklist.sh assess
